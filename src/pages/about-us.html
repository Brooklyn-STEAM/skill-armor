  <br>
  <p class="text-xl max-w-4xl mx-auto text-center text-tom-thumb-400">We are currently full-stack development students at the Brooklyn STEAM Center. Here, we have been assigned the task of creating a business that we believe would benefit society. During our brainstorming sessions, we focused on a significant issue that is increasingly relevant today: the rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI). This led us to develop the idea for Skill Armor, a platform that offers online courses and certifications for individuals looking to reskill for AI-resistant roles and careers. Our goal is to support those at risk of job displacement due to AI advancements.</p>
